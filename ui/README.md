## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) v5
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO client
- **Build Tool**: Create React App

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Running FHIR agent backends (Autogen and/or CrewAI)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the ui directory:
```env
REACT_APP_AUTOGEN_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
REACT_APP_CREWAI_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_FHIR_SERVER_URL=https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Patient Selection
1. Navigate to "Patient Search" in the sidebar
2. Search for patients by name or ID
3. Select a patient to view their details
4. Click "Start AI Assessment" to begin

### 2. Starting an Assessment
1. Go to "Agent Console"
2. Select the framework (Autogen or CrewAI)
3. Choose assessment type:
   - **Comprehensive**: Full patient evaluation
   - **Emergency**: Rapid triage assessment
   - **Medication Review**: Focus on drug interactions
4. Click "Start Assessment"

### 3. Interacting with Agents
1. Type questions or requests in the chat interface
2. Agents will respond based on their specialties
3. Review recommendations and clinical insights
4. End the conversation when complete

### 4. Reviewing History
1. Visit "Conversation History"
2. Browse past assessments and conversations
3. View summaries and recommendations
4. Export reports as needed

## API Integration

The UI integrates with two backend services:

### Autogen Service (Port 8001)
- `/conversation/comprehensive` - Start comprehensive assessment
- `/conversation/emergency` - Start emergency assessment  
- `/conversation/medication-review` - Start medication review
- `/patient/{id}/summary` - Get patient summary

### CrewAI Service (Port 8000)
- `/assessment/comprehensive` - Run comprehensive assessment
- `/assessment/emergency` - Run emergency assessment
- `/patient/{id}/summary` - Get patient summary
